    summary: |
      I have been starting companies since I was 13 years old. I have built and managed remote teams of up to 12 engineers, designers and product managers in various businesses.

        After stepping into a CTO role after there was a 5 month vacuum of technical/product leadership, there was a ton of tech, management and emotional baggage I had to work through with the team. Even still, we accomplished some incredible things.

        - Built the first publically available, Deep Learning skin skin classifier for over 124 skin conditions.
        - Lead the FDA submission documentation and internal compliance process.
        - Managed all technology development and product management for almost a year.
        - Significantly improved the relationships between the different teams.
        - In an effort to make the whole company priorities and progress crystal clear, transissioned the entire company from Github issues to Clubhouse.io. This resulted in the team making helpful design decisions and tangible feedback where everyone saw momentum in our company. 
        - Immedidately implemented (bi)weekly one on ones with everyone on my team.
        - Recruited 2 engineers and 3 devops consultants within 2 months of being in the role.

        All of the above was accomplished with me and a number of our team members being entirely remote.
